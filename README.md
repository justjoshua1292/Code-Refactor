Homework assignment #1 - Code Refactor!
This website was updated to highlight functionality & working semantic HTML elements.
We used tags like <aside>, <footer>, <header>, <section> & <main> to replace all of the <div> tags on the page.
  By using these tags, we were able to set up a webpage in proper format. 
  Structure is key to the format of a webpage.
  The CSS was also updated to reflect the ID's & classes on the page as well.
