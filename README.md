# Code Refactor-Homework
Homework assignment #1 - Code Refactor!
This website was updated to highlight that the page needed better functionality & working semantic HTML elements, as well as ALT tags for images.
We used tags like aside, footer, header, section & main to replace all of the div tags on the page.
  By using these tags, we were able to set up a webpage in proper format. 
  Structure is key to the format of a webpage.
  The CSS was also updated to reflect the ID's & classes on the page as well. 
  
  The sections can be found in order:
  Top of the HTML: You can find the meta data, as well as the metadata containing the info for the webpage.
  The new title - Horiseon"
  Head: Search Engine, Online Rep, Social Media Marketing bulleted list on the top of the webpage.
  Body/sections - Search Engine, Online Rep, Social Media Marketing with selected images & information for each block & alt tags

  Main - The actual image that covers most of the webpage - (three individuals in the office setting)
  Aside - The box and selected text on the side of the page.
  Footer- Closing copyright & end of document.
